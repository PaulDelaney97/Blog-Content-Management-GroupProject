## Description

This project is a group project where we designed and built a Blog/Content management Web App using SQL, Java, SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap Css, HTML.

## Groupworking Process

We held regular group calls to discuss and work on the project. Each member contributed with regular commits and we created a trello board to manage our workload.

## Running the WebApp on your local machine

We have included the SQL scripts required to create our database. Dowload our project, run the SQL scripts on your machine to create the database, build and run the project using your IDE, view the app in browser on localhost.
